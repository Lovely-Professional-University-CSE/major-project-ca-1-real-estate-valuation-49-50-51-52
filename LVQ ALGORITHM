Step 1: initialize
Step 2: Use any clustering algithm first which is suitable for you
Step 3: find the minimal distance from every point to all the other point in that topology
Step 4: find the winning weight
Step 5: check for the target if they match
Step 6: update the weights
Step 7: decrease the topology
