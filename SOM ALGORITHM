SOM (self organizing maps)
1: initialize the weights
2: from every other point you try to find the distance
3: find the ining weight you have been searching
4: once found you move that weight toward that topological order
5: decrease the topology
6: iterate it for some epochs


______you finally get the topology that is clustered value______
