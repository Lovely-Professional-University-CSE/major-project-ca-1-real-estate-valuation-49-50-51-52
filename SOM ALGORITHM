SOM (self organizing maps)
Step 1: initialize the weights
Step 2: from every other point you try to find the distance between each other
Step 3: find the minimal weight you have been searching
Step 4: once found you move that weight toward that topological order
Step 5: decrease the topology
Step 6: iterate it for some epochs


______you finally get the topology that is clustered value______
