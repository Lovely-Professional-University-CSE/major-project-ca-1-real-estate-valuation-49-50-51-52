SVM (support vector machine)
In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
Given a set of training examples,
each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories,
an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other,
making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting).
An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space,
mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.
New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on the side of the gap on which they fall.
