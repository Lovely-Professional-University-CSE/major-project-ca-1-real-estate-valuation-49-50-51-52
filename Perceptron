In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. 
A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, 
represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class
{\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} )={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}\ \mathbf {w} \cdot \mathbf {x} +b>0,\\0&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}}
